# Design Guidelines - Proflex Solutions

## Theme

Our website is for selling software to enterprises, so the theme should be serious and professional.

## Colours

- Primary colour: #473372 (purple)
- Secondary colour: #2B8093 (blue)
- Tertiary colour: #5F8B05 (green)

- Neutral colours: #D9D9D9 (lightgrey)

## Hierarchy and layout

- Most important message: What the company is/does
- 12-column grid
- Header and footer will always be on the page, and then the main content is changed based on what the user decides to look at

## Images

- For products we will have a main image as banner to showcase the product
- Products will have a few images, and then some text on the side
- We will use an overlay on top of the hero image on the frontpage
- Products will have a shorter overlay banner in the center of the main image

## Icons

- We will use icons for "user" icon on navbar, and for product management for admin
- They will be greyscale
- Icons will be in SVG format

## Typography

- Primary font (paragraphs): Open sans
- Main headings: Lalezar
- Other headings: Poiret One

## Border rounding

- Buttons and input fields should have slightly rounded corners
- Images that are not hero/banner should have slighly rounded corners (less than buttons)

## Shadows

- A very subtle shadow on navbar and all forms (login)

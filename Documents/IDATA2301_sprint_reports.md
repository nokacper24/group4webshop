# Sprint reports for IDATA2301 Web Tech

## Sprint 1
Period: 12. January-12. February
### Goals
- Basic layout and style for all pages (with React) 
	-   Frontpage 
	-   Product Grid page 
	-   Single Product page 
	-   About/Contact page 
-   Query DB data (products and users) with API and show on the page

### What we finished:
-   We made a detailed mockup of all the pages 
-   Made the following pages (with little to no real functionality, using placeholder data): 
	-   Header and footer components, front page, all products page, purchase license page, support page, about us page, sign up/log in page, profile page, and manage license access page. 
	-   We started on the individual product page, but did not finish it.

### What we did not finish:
-   The individual product page. 
-   Query DB data with API. The frontend is not connected to the backend.

### Reflection:
-   The product page should have been finished in sprint 1, as the pages that are directly needed for the user to buy and use our products are more important than pages for management.  
-   Members of the group should communicate better in order to get a more cohesive style on the pages. 
-   The component structures are good. At first, we planned on using a class that extends the Component class but moved over to functional components instead to follow best practices.  
-   It's good that all the components are documented.  
-   In the Lighthouse analysis, the website scores 100 on both Best Practices and Accessibility, and less relevantly 100 on SEO, but around 70 on Performance, which should be improved.

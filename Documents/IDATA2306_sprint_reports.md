# Sprint reports for IDATA2306 App Dev

## Sprint 1
Period: 12. January - 12. February
### Goals and outcomes: 
- Create database schema     
	- Done, there were minor changes during REST API development. 
- Query DB data 
	- Done, using SQLx crate. Mostly product details, some user-related queries. 
- Some REST API endpoints 
	- Done, mostly finished for acquiring products and product details. 
- Serving HTML files 
	- not done. 
- Running server application locally 
	- The server application with REST endpoints works, but no html files are served.
### Retrospective:
We have finished most of the goals we set for sprint 1. Serving HTML files will need to be done in sprint 2. We have also started working on things that are relevant to later sprints, such as product creation.  
There are several problems we have not included in the project plans that have come up. These problems include comprehensive API documentation or serving images through our webserver. All these issues should be addressed in sprint 2.
